# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution to `touchque-authenticator/php-sdk`.

## Setup

```bash
composer install
```

## Running tests

```bash
composer test
```

Some suites run **contract tests** against `testing/fake-touchque-api.mjs` — a
small, dependency-free Node server that verifies the SDK's HMAC request
signatures exactly like the real API does. These need `node` on `PATH`; they
skip themselves otherwise.

## Making a change

1. If it touches the wire protocol or the step-up contract, update the
   fixtures in `fixtures/` and the fake API in `testing/` first.
2. Add tests. A behavior change without a test won't be merged.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format) under `## [Unreleased]`.
4. Keep code, comments, docs and error messages in English.
5. Don't add a dependency to the SDK's core (only `TouchQue\Laravel\*` may
   depend on a framework, and only as an optional suggest/require-dev).

## Pull requests

- Describe what changed and why, not just what. If it's a breaking change,
  say so explicitly and explain the migration.
- CI must pass (`composer test`, and keep `composer validate --strict` clean).

## Reporting a security issue

Please don't open a public issue — see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
